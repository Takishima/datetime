# Testing code doesn't work on pre-25 Emacses even though the library
# itself probably works on 24.x.  The reason is `make-process', which
# is new in 25.  We cannot do without it since we need to ignore
# stderr in order for tests to work (as due to whatever setup quirks
# on Travis Java programs write some crap about _JAVA_OPTIONS to
# stderr).  Don't care much.
